Flappy Duck is a game I made as apart of my journey to learning how to use the MonoGame framework.
I'm working to make 20 Games in total with MonoGame to develop my own game engine systems for the framework.

All of the art, and programming was done myself. I used many resources to learn how to work within the Monogame Framework.
Including books, video tutorials, and forums.

This project took roughly 4 days ( 8hr work days) to complete. I used Marmosette Hexels3 to create the pixel art, 
grabbed some audio from https://opengameart.org/ ( please see the credits document in the compiled game folder for more details ).
And I programmed all of this using Visual Studio Code Community, as it is the Mono Game reccomended environment.

Anyone who wishes to use my source code or modify the source code to make their own MonoGame projects is welcome to do so. 
All the files related to the game engine are locaed in the Engine folder, where you can find some helpful base classes to use
as a foundation. 

That being said if you want to understand the code better I reccomend the following resources:

             1.) https://www.youtube.com/@codingwithsphere
                 Super helpful channel with straightforward, easy to understand explainations. 
             2.) https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-6309-9
                 Great way to build these foundational systems yourself, However not all of the code
                 is reviewed in the book. the Github repository for the book is crutial for you to follow along.
